  <p>Dear sir/madam,</p>

    My name is <strong>Aditya Ashok Mane</strong>, and I am writing to express my interest in any suitable openings in your organization for the role of a React.js, Next.js Developer, or Frontend Developer.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I have completed my graduation in Bachelor of Science in Information Technology from Nirmala Memorial Foundation College, Kandivali (Mumbai). Most recently, I completed an internship at Oneroof Technologies where I worked as a React.js Developer. During my internship, I had the opportunity to contribute to live projects and strengthen my technical skills, including React.js, Next.js, Git, Bitbucket, and basic SEO.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I have attached my resume for your review. I would be grateful for the opportunity to discuss any potential roles you might have that align with my skills and interests.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.
  </p>

    Warm regards,<br>
